**Customer Churn Prediction**

Overview

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting customer churn using various machine-learning models. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, allowing the business to take proactive measures to retain them. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Contents

ChurnPrediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
data_descriptions.csv, train.csv, test.csv: Example datasets used in the notebook for training and testing.

Objective

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn. We explore various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize their performance.

Installation Guide

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

Libraries
You can install the required libraries using pip. Below is the list of main libraries used in this project:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
You can install these libraries by running:

bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/CustomerChurnPrediction.git](https://github.com/KritPrasad05/Churn_Prediction-Coursera_Project_Network.git)
cd CustomerChurnPrediction

Install the required libraries:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash


jupyter notebook ChurnPrediction.ipynb

Usage

Open the ChurnPrediction.ipynb notebook and follow the steps provided. The notebook is divided into sections:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load and explore the datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models to predict churn.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using Grid Search.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results

After training and tuning the models, we found that the Logistic Regression model with specific hyperparameters achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 0.68 and balanced recall for churn prediction.
